        <h2>By Billie Eillish</h2>
        <p>[Intro]</p>
        <p>[Verse 1]</p>
            <p>I want you to stay<br>
            'Til I'm in the grave<br>
            'Til I rot away, dead and buried<br>
            'Til I'm in the casket you carry<br>
            If you go, I'm goin' too, uh<br>
            'Cause it was always you (Alright)<br>
            And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me<br>
            Nothin' left to lose without my baby</p>

        <p>[Refrain]</p>
        <p>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know<br>
            I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone<br>
            Can't change the weather, might not be forever<br>
            But if it's forever, it's even better</p>

        <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>And I don't know what I'm cryin' for<br>
            I don't think I could love you more<br>
            It might not be long, but baby, I</p>

        <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>I'll love you 'til the day that I die<br>
            'Til the day that I die<br>
            'Til the light leaves my eyes<br>
            'Til the day that I die</p>

            <p>[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>I want you to see, hm<br>
                How you look to me, hm<br>
                You wouldn't believe if I told ya<br>
                You would keep the compliments I throw ya<br>
                But you're so full of shit, uh<br>
                Tell me it's a bit, oh<br>
                Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted<br>
                Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid</p>

                <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
                <p>And I don't know what I'm cryin' for,<br>
                    I don't think I could love you more<br>
                    Might not be long, but baby, I<br>
                    Don't wanna say goodbye</p>

                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
                    <p>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('Til the day that I die)<br>
                        I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('Til the light leaves my eyes)<br>
                        Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('Til the day that I die)<br>
                        But if it's forever, it's even better</p>

                        <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
                        <p>I knew you in another life<br>
                            You had that same look in your eyes<br>
                            I love you, don't act so surprised</p>
